## Understanding the Basics

In this section, let's unravel the fundamental aspects of Power BI Quick measures. Gain a better understanding on what Quick measures are, how they enhance data analytics, and take a tour of the pre-defined Quick measures. It's about laying the foundation, ensuring we have a solid understanding of Quick measures to effectively leverage its features within our data analytics.

### What are Power BI Quick Measures?

Power BI Quick measures is a feature that propels your data analysis to new heights by allowing the creation of common and powerful calculations without getting entangled in a web of complex DAX formulas. Quick measures allow us to drag and drop columns  within our data model to generate predefined measures such as aggregate measures, time intelligence, filters, etc.

A Quick measure runs the DAX commands out of sight and returns the results to you. There is no writing DAX, it is all done based on what you provide when setting up the Quick measure. Better yet, after creating the Quick measure you can see the DAX required by the measure. This is helpful to kick-start and expand your DAX knowledge.

It’s like having a personal assistant that takes over the heavy lifting of data calculations, allowing us to focus on extracting valuable insights and making data-driven decisions. It’s all about simplifying the complex, making data analytics a breeze rather than a hurdle.

### How Quick Measures Enhance Data Analytics

Quick measures work by automating the creation of common measures and calculations. This automation not only saves time but also ensures the accuracy and consistency of our data analysis. It helps to minimize the potential for human error in our measures, ensuring that our insights are based on reliable and accurate data. It’s focused on enhancing efficiency, helping us get more done in less time.

### Exploring the Quick Measures

The pre-defined Quick measures is a treasure trove for anyone looking to enhance their data analytics. It offers a range of pre-built calculations, ready to be used and customized. It offers us tools and resources to make our data analytics more efficient, more accurate, and more impactful. The pre-defined measures is a testament to the versatility and power of Quick measures, showcasing the various ways in which it can be leveraged to enhance our data analysis and decision-making.

Additionally, in the Quick measures pane there is the Suggestions with Copilot feature to further the Quick measures experience. This feature, when enabled, offers intelligent measure suggestions as we type, making it even easier and faster to create measures. 

However, it is crucial to note that these suggestions are not a replacement for learning and understanding DAX. The suggestions provided by this feature are not perfect are only meant to help fast track measure creation. We will still need to validate the DAX suggestions to ensure their accuracy and that they match our intent.

## Diving Deep into Power BI Quick Measures

In this section, we will delve deeper into the world of Power BI Quick measures. Learn how to create and use Quick measures with a step-by-step guide and explore how to customize them for advanced insights. We will also look at common Quick Measures examples and their applications.

### Creating and Using Quick Measures

**Step-by-Step Guide to Create Measures**

Creating a Quick measure in Power BI is a straightforward process. Let's use this feature to create a new measure which calculates the average sales per product type.

1. From the Table view, locate and right click the column that is going to be used within the measure. For this example we will use `Amount`.
2. Select New quick measure to display the Quick measure pane.
3. In the dropdown we will see a list of all the pre-defined quick measure grouped by type. Select Average per category.
4. The Amount field should appear in the Base Value, if not drag and drop it.
5. For category in the Products table locate the Product field, then drag and drop it in the Category box.
6. Click Add.

![Create a Quick Measure](/assets/img/2023-10-06-quick-measures/average-quick-measure.gif){: .post__img}

>You can also display the Quick Measures pane from the Report view tab by selecting Quick Measure under the Modeling tab on the ribbon.

Easy as that we, now have a new measure in our data model that calculates the average sales per product category. It can be helpful to rename the measure, for example `Average Sales by Product`. We can review the DAX formula the quick measure generated to provide this result.

```
Average Sales by Product = 
AVERAGEX(
	KEEPFILTERS(VALUES('Products'[Product])),
	CALCULATE(SUM('Sales'[Amount]))
)
```

And now this measure can be used within our report or for additional calculations for further insights.

### Common Quick Measures examples and their applications

#### Time intelligence calculations
Utilizing our `DateTable` we can quickly create time intelligence measures using the pre-defined Quick measures. For example, one quick measure in the Time intelligence section is Year-to-date total. Using this we can create a measure and visualize our monthly sales along with our year-to-date total in no time.

![Year-to-Date Sales Quick Measure](/assets/img/2023-10-06-quick-measures/ytd-quick-measure.png){: .post__img}

Here is the DAX formula the Quick Measure used for this calculation.

```
YTD Sales = 
TOTALYTD(SUM('Sales'[Amount]), 'Date Table'[Date])
```

This is quick and efficient way to bring the power of time intelligence functions into our data analysis allowing us to visualize and uncover additional insights.

#### Running totals and moving averages

We can use Quick Measures to create new measures for running totals, for example we can use the `Running total` pre-defined quick measure (under the Totals heading) to calculate the total of our sales amounts. This will give a cumulative total of sales over time, providing insight into sales growth. 

![Running Total Sales](/assets/img/2023-10-06-quick-measures/quick-measure-rolling-total.png){: .post__img}

Similarly, we can use the `Rolling average` quick measure to smooth out short-term fluctuations in order to better understand longer-term trends in sales.

#### Leveraging Suggestions for Quick Measures

Make the most of the suggestions feature in Power BI to enhance our Quick measures. For instance, let's use suggestions to help create a measure to analyze sales within the United States. As we type, Power BI will provide suggestions for creating the measure, helping you to efficiently create the new measure.

To create this measure we start typing `Total sales for United...` and we see a suggestion for `Total sales for United States (region name)`.

![Quick Measure Suggestions](/assets/img/2023-10-06-quick-measures/quick-measure-suggestion-us-sales.png){: .post__img}

Selecting this suggestion and then generate provides the following DAX formula to calculate the sum of the sales for the United States region, making use or our previous `Total Sales` measure.

![Quick Measure Suggested Measure](/assets/img/2023-10-06-quick-measures/quick-measure-suggested-measure.png){: .post__img}

>**Remember:** We need to validate the DAX suggestions to ensure it is accurate and aligns with our analytical goals.

For this example we can verify that the measure calculates the correct value, ensuring the accuracy of the measure.

![Total US Sales](/assets/img/2023-10-06-quick-measures/quick-measure-total-validation.png){: .post__img}

The second part of validating the suggestion is to ensure it matches our intent. A key question to ask before using this measure is *how do we want to handle external filters?*. External filters refer to any filter not contained within the DAX formula.

The suggested formula uses `KEEPFILTERS` which will keep the external filters that have been applied to the `Regions[Region]` field in the report or visual. The measure adds an additional filter, it will not override existing context. This can be useful when working with a complex report where multiple filters are applied, and we want to ensure that the existing external filters are not overridden.

An alternative to consider would be a measure that does override external filters on the `Regions[Region]` field.

```
United States Sales = CALCULATE(
    'Sales'[Total Sales],
    'Regions'[Region] = "United States"
)
```

This would be an example of a formula we could use when we need a measure that is exclusively for United States sales, regardless of other filters applied in the report.

Creating this United States sales measure highlights the power and ease we can create measure using the suggestions feature. But also shines a light on its limitations, and shows that it is not a replacement for knowing and understanding DAX but rather a tool to supplement your knowledge.
