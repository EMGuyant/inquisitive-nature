## QA Metric Calculation
QAData - Python program for processing raw input data files and produces an output file containing various Quality Assurance measures. This project was completed as part of a Python course, and is not maintained.

## Description:
Program takes an input CSV file (raw data input rigid format) creates a dataframe of data, splits the Spike and Duplicate ";" delimiated string values and generates a corresponding list of values to be used for QA calculations. For each record in the input file a instance of the QA class is created and the Spike/Duplicate value is assigned, and the known spiking concentration, percent recovery, and relative percent difference are all calculated. After calculation of QA metrics a determination is made for each item on whether it passes or fails specific QA limits. Finally an outputs CSV is created containing the item ID, Spike Recovery, Spike Pass/Fail, Duplicate Recovery, Duplicate Pass/Fail, Relative Percent Difference (spike/duplicate), and RPD Pass/Fail. A QA summary is then displayed on the user interface, and the user can view the output file or exit the program.
