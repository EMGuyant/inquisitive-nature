## Introduction

<br>

In the world of data analysis, the ability to derive meaningful insights from raw data is crucial. Power BI empowers you to go beyond just the basics and unlock the full potential of your data through calculated measures and columns. These game-changing features allow you to perform complex calculations and create new data points based on existing information. Enabling you to gain deeper insights and make more and better informed decisions.

## Calculated Measures

<br>

Creating calculated measures in Power BI is a straightforward process. With just a few simple steps, you can unleash a whole new level of analysis. For example, say you have a sales dataset and want to calculate the average unit price of products sold. This can easily be accomplished by creating a calculated measure.

Start by opening Power BI Desktop and navigating to the report or dataset where you want to create the calculated measure. Right-click on the desired table, select `New Measure` and enter the required formula or expression that defines the calculation. To demonstrate the example above we will enter `Average Unit Price = AVERAGE(SalesOrderDetail[UnitPrice])`.

Power BI will instantly calculate the average unit price based on the defined formula.

But wait, there is more! Calculated measure go way beyond just calculating basic aggregations.  We can step up our calculated measure game by using DAX iterator functions.  Iterator functions are DAX expressions that operate row-by-row, or in Power BI referred to as having row context. These functions typically end with an `X` (e.g. `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`). 

Our `Sales` table has `OrderQty`, `UnitPrice` and `UnitPriceDiscount` columns but no column for the sales amount. We are interested in this sales amount value and how it trend over time.

To analyze this we can create a new measure `Sales Amount` defined by the following expression:

`SalesAmount = SUMX(SalesOrderDetail, SalesOrderDetail[OrderQty] * SalesOrderDetail[UnitPrice] * (1 - SalesOrderDetail[UnitPriceDiscount]))`

This calculated measure allows you to gain insights into the overall sales performance and identify patterns or trends over time.

Whether it's aggregating data, calculating ratios, or applying logical functions, Power BI offers a rich set of DAX functions that have got you covered.

## Calculated Columns

<br>

In addition to calculated measures Power BI also offers the ability to create calculated columns. Calculated column take your data analysis to another level by allowing you to create new data points at the individual row level. The possibilities are endless when you can combine existing columns, apply conditional logic, or generate dynamic values. Let's consider a products dataset where you have the `Product Number` which contains a two letter product type code followed by the product number. For your analysis you require an additional column containing just the product type identifier. Calculated columns are well suited to meet this need.

Within Power BI Desktop right-click the table where you want to add the calculated column, select `New Column`, and define the formula or expression. To extract the first two characters (i.e. the product type code) we will use `ProductType = LEFT(Products[ProductNumber],2)`

Power BI will extract the first two characters of the `Product Number` for each row, creating a new `Product Type` column. This calculated column makes it easier to analyze and filter data based on the product type. Power BI's intuitive interface and DAX language make this process seamless and approachable.

The post highlights the key differences between calculated measures and column and when it is best practice or beneficial to use one method over the other.

## Beyond the Basics

<br>

Why limit yourself to basic calculations? Power BI's calculated measures and columns give you the power to dig deeper into your data. Using complex calculations you can uncover deeper patterns, trends, and correlations that were previously hidden.  For example, with our sales data we want to analyze the percentage of total sales for each product type. With Power BI, you can create a calculated measure using the formula: 

```
Percentage Sales =
VAR Sales = SalesOrderDetail[Sales Amount]
VAR AllSales = CALCULATE(SalesOrderDetail[Sales Amount], REMOVEFILTERS(Products[Product Type]))

RETURN
DIVIDE(Sales, AllSales)
```

![Percentage Sales](/assets/img/2023-06-29-calculated-measures-columns/percentage-sales.gif){: .post__img}

Uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that have not been discovered previously. Calculate year-to-date sales, compare performance against targets, or create custom hierarchies on the fly, among many many other calculations. The possibilities are endless, and the insights are invaluable.

### Important Concepts

To continue to elevate your skills in developing calculated measures and columns there are a few concepts to understand. These include row context, filter context, and context transition.

When Power BI evaluates DAX expressions the values the expression can access are limited by what is referred to as the evaluation context. The two fundamental types of evaluation context are row context and filter context.
