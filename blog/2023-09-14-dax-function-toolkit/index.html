<h2 id="new-dax-functions-the-new-kids-on-the-block">New DAX Functions: The New Kids on the Block</h2>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In the dynamic landscape of DAX, staying abreast of updates is not merely optional—it’s imperative. Just when we think we have mastered the existing functions, DAX introduces innovative features that can revolutionize our approach to data analysis. These aren’t just incremental updates. They are game-changers that can redefine how we approach our data analysis. These updates are introduced periodically, so get ready to get acquainted with these new kids on the block in order to stay ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>What makes these new functions even better is that they are far more that just bells and whistles, they all serve a purpose. They often fill gaps in existing functionality or offer more efficient ways to get the job done. For instance, some functions make complex calculations easier, while others offer new ways to manipulate data.</p>

<h2 id="aggregation-functions-the-core-of-data-summaries">Aggregation Functions: The Core of Data Summaries</h2>

<p>Imagine we are an analyst faced with the task of sifting through a large dataset to quickly determine the total sales for a specific month. Aggregation functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SUM</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COUNT</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AVERAGE</code> are our go-to tools for this job. These functions serve as the foundation for transforming extensive datasets into actionable insights, such as identifying daily sales peaks, calculating average customer ratings, or estimating annual revenue. Their importance cannot be overstated. They are the essential tools that allow us to distill mountains of data into digestible, meaningful metrics. Whether we are under pressure to deliver fast results or striving for a comprehensive analysis, aggregation functions are indispensable.</p>

<h3 id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid">Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Ignoring Data Types: Ensure that the data types in the columns we are aggregating are compatible with the function we are using. For instance, using SUM on a text column will result in an error.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overlooking Filters: When using functions like CALCULATE, remember that existing filters in the data model can affect the result. Always double-check report filters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Misunderstanding Scope: Be cautious when defining the scope of our aggregation. A common mistake is to aggregate over an entire table when a more specific range is required.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="practical-examples">Practical Examples</h3>

<p>Let’s get into some hands-on examples to better understand these aggregation functions. To start, consider the task of calculating average sales. We can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AVERAGE</code> function to quickly gauge our typical sales size.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Average Sales = AVERAGE(Sales[Amount])
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-09-15-dax-function-toolkit/average-function.jpg" alt="Average Function Example" class="post__img" /></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Average Sales</code> calculates the average of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Amount</code> column in the Sales table, giving us a quick idea of our typical sale size.</p>

<p>Next, suppose we have a more specific query: we want to know the total sales of Smartphones within the United Sates. For this, we can employ the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CALCULATE</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SUM</code> functions together.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Total Smartphone Sales US = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]), 
    Products[Product]="Smartphone", 
    Regions[Region]="United States"
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-09-15-dax-function-toolkit/sum-function.jpg" alt="Sum Function Example" class="post__img" /></p>

<p>This formula sums up the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Amount</code> column from the Sales table but filters it to only include rows where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Product</code> is “Smartphone” in the Products table and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Region</code> is “United States” in the Regions table.</p>

<h2 id="date-and-time-functions-managing-temporal-data">Date and Time Functions: Managing Temporal Data</h2>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Date and Time Functions are indispensable when we are dealing with time-sensitive data. Whether we are analyzing sales trends over multiple quarters or tracking project timelines, functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TODAY</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DATEDIFF</code> are invaluable tools. Understanding the temporal aspects of our data can uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities that would otherwise remain hidden. These functions allow us to slice and dice our data across various time frames, making them essential for tasks such as trend analysis, forecasting, and even real-time decision-making.</p>

<h3 id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid-1">Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Time Zone Differences: When dealing with data across geographic location, always considers time zones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Date Formats: Keeping date formats consistent is non-negotiable for precise analysis.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="practical-examples-1">Practical Examples</h3>

<p>Let’s explore some real-world applications of these functions. First, rather than glancing at the calendar to find the current date we want to include the date directly in our report. By employing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TODAY</code> function we can easily do this.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Today's Date = TODAY()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-09-15-dax-function-toolkit/today-function.jpg" alt="Today Function Example" class="post__img" /></p>

<p>Just like that, we have today’s date at our fingertips, ready for reporting.</p>

<p>Now, consider a more complex scenario. We are interested in understanding the sales cycle for Smartphones in the United States. We want to know the duration between the first and last sale. Instead of manually counting days, DAX offers a more elegant solution.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Days Between First and Last Smartphone Sale US = 
DATEDIFF(
    MINX(
        FILTER(
            Sales, 
            Products[Product]="Smartphone" &amp;&amp; 
            Regions[Region]="United States"
        ), 
        Sales[SalesDate]
    ), 
    MAXX(
        FILTER(
            Sales, 
            Products[Product]="Smartphone" &amp;&amp; 
            Regions[Region]="United States"
        ), 
        Sales[SalesDate]
    ), 
    DAY
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-09-15-dax-function-toolkit/datediff-function.jpg" alt="DATEDIFF Example" class="post__img" /></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Days Between First and Last Smartphone Sale US</code> calculates the number of days between the first and last sale of Smartphones in the United States. This gives us a clearer understanding of the sales cycle, which can be a critical piece of information for proper planning.</p>

<h3 id="keep-exploring-aggregation-functions-1">Keep Exploring Aggregation Functions</h3>

<p>Date and Time Functions are not just convenient, they are fundamental in data analysis for dissecting temporal aspects of our data. They enable us to analyze our data through the lens of time, providing a more nuanced understanding of trends and patterns.</p>

<p>For those looking for more information on Date and Time Functions check out the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/date-and-time-functions-dax" class="post__link">Microsoft DAX Function Reference on Date and Time Functions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="filter-functions-refining-your-data-views">Filter Functions: Refining Your Data Views</h2>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Filter Functions act as the gatekeepers of our data. They enable us to hone in on the specific subsets that are most relevant to our analysis. Functions like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FILTER</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ALL</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RELATED</code> are integral components of the DAX toolkit. Imagine we are a marketing manager keen on evaluating the impact of a recent campaign. We are not interested in the entirety of sales data, just the metrics pertinent to this specific initiative. Filter Functions empower us to focus our analysis by narrowing down the data to only the most relevant subsets, thereby enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of our insights.</p>

<h3 id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid-2">Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Overfiltering: While it is tempting to narrow down our data, be cautious not to filter out important information</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Underfiltering: On the filp side, too little filtering can leave us overwhelmed with irrelevant data.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For successful and efficient analysis it is important to strike the right balance.</p>

<h3 id="practical-examples-2">Practical Examples</h3>

<p>Now getting to the examples. We are interested in analyzing sales data for the United States. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FILTER</code> function can be used to create a new table that isolates this specific data.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>US Sales Table = 
FILTER(
    Sales, 
    RELATED(Regions[Region]) = "United States"
)
</code></pre></div></div>

Whether we are a seasoned finance manager or a small business owner just starting out, understanding our financial metrics is a necessity. Financial Functions enable us to perform a myriad of calculations, from determining loan payments and forecasting the future values of investments to calculating the net present value of cash flows. These functions are key for robust financial planning and analysis, guiding us toward sound financial decisions.</p>

<h3 id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid-3">Common Pitfalls to AVoid</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Incorrect Parameters: Always double-check the parameters when using financial functions to avoid errors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unit Consistency: Ensure that the time units (months, years, etc.) are consistent across calculations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="practical-examples-3">Practical Examples</h3>

<p>Let’s consider a scenario where we are assisting a finance manager in calculating the monthly payment for a loan. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PMT</code> function can help us do just that. Before diving in, it is essential to understand the syntax and parameters of this function.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PMT(&lt;rate&gt;, &lt;nper&gt;, &lt;pv&gt;[, &lt;fv&gt; [, &lt;type&gt;]])</code></p>

<p>The parameter are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;rate&gt;</code>: the interest rate of the loan</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;nper&gt;</code>: the total number of payments for the loan</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;pv&gt;</code>: the present value; also known as the principal</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;fv&gt;</code>: an optional parameter representing the future value or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;fv&gt;</code> is omitted, it is assumed to be BLANK.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;type&gt;</code>: an optional parameter representing when payments are due and indicated by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code> when payments are due at the end of the period or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> when payments are due at the beginning of the period. If omitted, it is assumed to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Armed with this understanding we can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PMT</code> function to calculate the monthly payment for a $20,000 loan with a 5% annual interest rate, spread over 60 months.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Monthly Loan Payment = PMT(0.05/12, 60, -20000)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-09-15-dax-function-toolkit/pmt-function.jpg" alt="PMT Example" class="post__img" /></p>

<p>This give us an understanding of the monthly financial commitment, aiding in budget planning and financial forecasting.</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="practical-examples-5">Practical Examples</h3>

<p>Now for the real-world applications. First, we need to categorize sales as either “High” or “Low” based on the sales amounts. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IF</code> function is perfectly suited for this task.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Sales Category = IF(Sales[Amount] &gt; 5000, "High", "Low")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-09-15-dax-function-toolkit/if-function.jpg" alt="IF Example" class="post__img" /></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sales Category</code> creates a calculated colum that categorizes sales as “High” if the amount exceeds $5,000 and “Low” otherwise.</p>

<p>For a more complex example, suppose we need to categorize sales based on multiple conditions, such as region and amount. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SWITCH</code> function is particularly useful here. The formula below categorizes sales as “High” or “Low” in the United States, Europe, and Asia, based on the sales amount and region.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Sales Category High/Low Region = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    Sales[Amount] &gt; 5000 &amp;&amp; Sales[RegionID] = 1, "High in US",
    Sales[Amount] &lt;= 5000 &amp;&amp; Sales[RegionID] = 1, "Low in US",
    Sales[Amount] &gt; 5000 &amp;&amp; Sales[RegionID] = 2, "High in Europe",
    Sales[Amount] &lt;= 5000 &amp;&amp; Sales[RegionID] = 2, "Low in Europe",
    Sales[Amount] &gt; 5000 &amp;&amp; Sales[RegionID] = 3, "High in Asia",
    Sales[Amount] &lt;= 5000 &amp;&amp; Sales[RegionID] = 3, "Low in Asia",

<p>Table Manipulation Functions in DAX serve as the architects of our data landscape, empowering us to reshape, transform, and manipulate tables. Whether we are creating new tables, modifying existing ones, or generating tables on-the-fly for specific analyses. These functions offer the flexibility to customize our data to meet a wide array of analytical needs.</p>

<h3 id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid-11">Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Performance Issues: Complex table manipulations can be resource-intensive. Be mindful of the impact on query performance, especially when working with large datasets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Loss of Context: Functions that create new tables in the data model may lose the context or relationships present in the original tables. Make sure to re-establish any necessary relationships.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="practical-examples-11">Practical Examples</h3>

<p>We need to analyze the total sales for each product to aid in identifying best sellers. To do this we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SUMMARIZE</code> to create a new table that shows the total sales for each Product.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Product Sales Summary = 
SUMMARIZE(
    Sales, 
    Sales[SalesDate].[Year], 
    Products[Product Code], 
    Products[Product], 
    "Total Sales", 
    SUM(Sales[Amount])
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-09-15-dax-function-toolkit/summarize-function.jpg" alt="SUMMARIZE Example" class="post__img" /></p>

<p>The resulting table will provide a quick way to identify which products are flying off the shelves each year and which are not.</p>

<p>Next, we need would like to better understand how each sales employee is performing across the different regions, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GROUPBY</code> function come in handy.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Sales by Region and Employee = 
GROUPBY(
    Sales, 
    Regions[Region], 
    Employee[EmployeeName], 
    "Total Sales", 
    SUMX(CURRENTGROUP(), 
    Sales[Amount])
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-09-15-dax-function-toolkit/groupby-function.jpg" alt="GROUPBY Example" class="post__img" /></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sales by Region and Employee</code> is a newly created table which aggregates sales amounts by the Region and Employee. Essentially, it is like crafting a leader board for our sales team, broken down by geographical areas.</p>

<h2 id="text-functions-manipulating-and-analyzing-text-data">Text Functions: Manipulating and Analyzing Text Data</h2>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In the realm of data analysis, Text Functions in DAX serve as the wordsmiths that empower us to manipulate and transform text data within our data sets. These functions are a key aspect of cleaning, formatting, and extracting valuable insights from textual data. While numbers may be the backbone of data analysis, textual data often provides the context, nuance, and additional layers of meaning that numbers alone can’t offer. These functions help us make sense of textual data, which is often messy and unstructured.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://ethanguyant.com/blog/2023-08-14-text-functions/" class="post__link">Master DAX Text Expressions: Making Sense of Your Data One String at a Time</a> offers a deep dive into DAX Text functions.</p>

<h3 id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid-12">Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Case Sensitivity: DAX is not case-sensitive, but the text data we work with might be. Always be aware of the case requirements of the data to avoid inconsistencies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Special Characters: Not all text functions handle special characters gracefully. Before deploying any function, test it thoroughly to ensure it meets expectations, especially when the text data includes symbols or other special characters.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="practical-examples-12">Practical Examples</h3>

<p>Now for learning by doing. Our Employee table has a single Employee Name column containing each employee’s first and last name. We need to create a new column that shortens each employee’s name to their first initial followed by their last name. We can use a series of Text Functions to achieve this.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Short Name = 
VAR _space = 
    SEARCH(" ", Employee[EmployeeName])
VAR _firstInitial = 
    LEFT(Employee[EmployeeName], 1)
VAR _lastName = 
    RIGHT(Employee[EmployeeName], LEN(Employee[EmployeeName])-_space)

RETURN
CONCATENATE(_firstInitial, _lastName)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-09-15-dax-function-toolkit/concat-function.jpg" alt="CONCATENATE Example" class="post__img" /></p>

<p>This formula employs several text functions to create the Short Name column. The text functions includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SEARCH: finds the position in Employee Name of the first space</li>
  <li>LEFT: extracts the first letter of the employee’s full name</li>
  <li>RIGHT: extracts the last name from the employee’s full name</li>
  <li>LEN: calculates the length of the employee’s full name and is used to help RIGHT know how many characters to extract for the employee’s last name</li>
  <li>CONCATENATE: joins the employee’s first initial and the last name to create the employee’s shorten named field.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="time-intelligence-functions-analyzing-data-through-time">Time Intelligence Functions: Analyzing Data Through Time</h2>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Time Intelligence Functions in DAX empower us to perform calculations involving various time periods—be it months, quarters, or years. These functions are must-haves when it comes to trend analysis, forecasting, or comparing performance over different time frames. They allow us to unlock the temporal dimensions of our data, providing a dynamic lens through which to view our analytics.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://ethanguyant.com/blog/2023-07-19-powerbi-time-intelligence/" class="post__link">Time Travel in Power BI: Mastering Time Intelligence Functions</a> offers a deep dive into DAX Time Intelligence functions.</p>

<h3 id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid-13">Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Data Table: Ensure that there is a well-structured date table within the data model. These functions rely heavily on a coherent date table to operate effectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time Zone Differences: Be cautious of time zones when dealing with time-based data, especially if the data is collected from different geographical locations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="practical-examples-13">Practical Examples</h3>

<p>Let’s see how we can use these Time Intelligence functions. To complete our analysis of our sales data we need to track the sales performance throughout the year. To achieve this we will create a measure which tracks year-to-date sales.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>YTD Sales TOTALYTD = 
TOTALYTD(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]), Dates[Date]
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-09-15-dax-function-toolkit/totalytd-function.jpg" alt="TOTALYTD Example" class="post__img" /></p>

<p>This formula uses the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TOTALYTD</code> function to sum up the sales amounts from the beginning of the year to the current date. This is an essential metric for understanding sales performance as the year progresses and helpful to compare to previous years.</p>

<p>Next, we are interested in smoothing out short-term fluctuations to understand the longer-term trends in sales. To do this we will calculate a rolling 3-month average of our sales.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Sales 3 Month Rolling Average = 
CALCULATE(
    AVERAGE(Sales[Amount]),
    DATESBETWEEN(
        Dates[Date],
        EDATE(LASTDATE(Dates[Date]), -3),
        LASTDATE(Dates[Date])
    )
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/assets/img/2023-09-15-dax-function-toolkit/datesbetween-function.jpg" alt="3 Month Rolling Average" class="post__img" /></p>

<p>This formula uses the Time Intelligence functions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DATESBETWEEN</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LASTDATE</code> to help calculate the 3-month rolling average of sales. It provides a great tools to get a more stable view of our sales trends.</p>

<h3 id="keep-exploring-aggregation-functions-13">Keep Exploring Aggregation Functions</h3>

<p>Time Intelligence Functions are our navigational compass for traversing the sands of time within our data. They provide valuable insights whether we are looking backwards to historical data or forward to predictive analytics.</p>
